UX/UI Designer
--------------

I am a fan of the areas of Design and Technology, and I am increasingly looking for solutions that bring innovations to my daily life. As a student of these, I seek to improve myself to obtain more commitment every day to resolve complex situations and bring results to the people who seek my work, which can also be found at the Portuguese language.
